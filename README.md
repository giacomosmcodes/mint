# mint
Mint is a CLI-based file sharing and hosting service
## Features
* **Secure and private**: Mint clients never actually works with your files- think of Mint like a translator that structures and mediates communications between you and the host. Additionally, Mint has full Tor support for more anonymity.
* **Fast**: Mint is designed to be as lightweight on the upload/download process as possible- adding almost no latency to direct communications between the client and host.
* **Easy**: All you need to get started with Mint are two commands: `mint upload` and `mint download`. Adding more hosts or configuring identities is as easy as pasting in a few lines of JSON provided by the host.
